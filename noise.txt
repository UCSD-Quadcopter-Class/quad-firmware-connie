-Use sliding/moving window to get average of last x IMU readings. This helps smooth the IMU readings a lot. Without this, the readings are all over the place.
 The higher the x, the better the IMU readings, but the slower the PID control responds to changes. Set to 2 right now.
-Use low/hi pass filter for IMU.

-Use a complementary filter on IMU acc/gyro data to get pitch angle.
